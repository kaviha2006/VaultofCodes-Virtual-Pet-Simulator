## Vault of Code – Virtual Pet Simulator using Python

---

## Project Description
description: >
This project implements a Virtual Pet Simulator using Python as part of the
Vault of Codes Internship. The application allows users to take care of a
virtual pet by performing actions such as feeding, playing, and checking
the pet’s status. The simulator dynamically updates the pet’s hunger and
happiness levels, providing an interactive and engaging console-based
experience.

---

## Objective
objective: >
To design and develop an interactive Python application that simulates
real-life pet care activities, helping users understand programming
concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and state management.

---

## Features
features:

Create a virtual pet with a custom name

Feed the pet to reduce hunger level

Play with the pet to increase happiness level

Check pet status at any time

Automatic hunger and happiness level changes

Game-over conditions based on pet health

Menu-driven command-line interface

---

## Tech Stack
tech_stack:

Python

Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Visual Studio Code

---

## Game Logic
game_logic: >
The virtual pet maintains two main attributes: hunger level and happiness
level. User actions affect these attributes, and automatic changes are
applied after each interaction. If the hunger level becomes too high or
the happiness level drops too low, the game ends.

---

## How to Run
how_to_run:
requirements: "Python 3.x"
steps:
- Clone the repository or download the project files
- Open the project directory
- Run the application using the command below
run_command: "python virtual_pet.py"

## Output
output: >
The output of the Virtual Pet Simulator is displayed through an interactive
console interface. Screenshots demonstrating the gameplay, user interactions,
and pet status updates are included in this repository as output evidence.
